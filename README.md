# E-Commerce Microservices API

## Overview

This project is an E-Commerce API built using **.NET Core** and designed with a **microservices architecture**. It provides a set of services for managing various aspects of an e-commerce platform, including product management, customer accounts, orders, payments, and more. Each service operates independently, communicating with other services via HTTP and messaging queues.

## Features

- **Product Service**: Manages product catalogs, categories, and inventory.
- **Order Service**: Handles customer orders, order status, and payments.
- **Customer Service**: Manages customer accounts and profiles.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure login, JWT-based authentication, and user roles.
- **API Gateway**: Centralized point of access for client applications to interact with microservices.
- **Message Queue Integration**: Facilitates asynchronous communication between microservices (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).
- **Database**: Each microservice uses its own database to ensure data isolation.
  
## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: .NET 6/7 (C#)
- **API Communication**: RESTful APIs, gRPC (if applicable)
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka (depending on your setup)
- **Database**: SQL Server, MongoDB, or any other DB per service
- **Authentication**: JWT Tokens, IdentityServer (or another authentication provider)
- **Containerization**: Docker for containerizing services
- **API Gateway**: Ocelot or YARP (if used)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions / Jenkins / Azure DevOps (if applicable)
  
## Architecture

The system follows a **microservices architecture**, where each service is independent and communicates via:

- **REST APIs** for synchronous communication.
- **Message Queues** for asynchronous communication (event-driven).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- **.NET SDK**: [Download .NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- **Docker** (if you want to run the services in containers): [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- **Message Broker** (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka): Dockerized instances or local setup
- **SQL Server** or **MongoDB** (depending on your service setup): Local or containerized instance
  
### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/e-commerce-microservices-api.git
